Hi, this is the place to be,the one where you leave your hopes
and dreams behind and march on in full power to the end of time ...
or whatever. 

I see sunshine .

I learn to git gud. **random access user : i don't like git 

Running tests in order to get used to file editing and git-ing with Sublime Text 3 and GitHub for Windows. Much wow, very fun.

How about having a skype session and discussing what everyone has done so far?
